It is designed to be as simple to deploy as it is to use. The application allows you to manage all your orchestrator resources (containers, images, volumes, networks and more) through a smart GUI and/or an extensive API. Portainer consists of a single container that can run on any cluster. It can be deployed as a Linux container or a Windows native container.",
